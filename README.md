Good morning , My name is Akash Kumar Singh, and I’m delighted to be here today. I
am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering from Arya College
of Engineering & IT, Jaipur, with a strong academic record, holding a 9.60 CGPA. My
academic journey has been marked by consistent excellence, having scored 94.40% in
secondary school and 91.60% in higher secondary school from DAV Public School,
Kathara (Bokaro).
From the very beginning, I have been passionate about technology, problem-solving,
and innovation, which has driven me to explore various technical domains. One of my
key projects is a Restaurant Management System, which I developed using Python and
GUI. This project helped me gain practical experience in software development, user
interface design, and database management, giving me a deeper understanding of how
technology can solve real-world problems efficiently.
To further enhance my technical proficiency, I have undergone training and internships with
Salesforce and Celebal Technologies in Data Engineering, where I worked on data
processing, analytics, and cloud-based solutions. My core technical skills include
Python, C++, MySQL, Operating Systems, and Computer Networks, which I have
refined through coursework, hands-on projects, and industry exposure.
Beyond academics, I actively engage in technical events and extracurricular activities,
which have shaped my leadership and teamwork skills. I have participated in Zephyr’s
Gully Cricket, Autoignition, and Exergie’24, events that helped me develop resilience,
collaboration, and adaptability. Additionally, I hold a Red Hat Certification,
demonstrating my expertise in Linux and system administration. I have also completed
NPTEL certifications in Cloud Computing, Operating Systems, and Software Engineering, showcasing my commitment to continuous learning and professional
development.
Apart from my technical interests, I am an avid reader and enjoy books that contribute
to personal and professional growth. Currently, I am reading Atomic Habits by James
Clear, which has helped me build a mindset of consistency, discipline, and
improvement. I also love listening to podcasts related to technology, leadership, and
self-development, as they keep me updated with industry trends and enhance my
knowledge.
I believe my strengths lie in being goal-oriented, analytical, and a strong team player. I
am always eager to learn, innovate, and take on new challenges. My ability to think
critically, coupled with my dedication to continuous learning, makes me confident that I
can contribute positively to your organization.
Thank you for this opportunity! I look forward to discussing how my skills and
enthusiasm can align with your team’s goals
